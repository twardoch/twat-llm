# About this project

`twat-fs` is a file system utility library focused on robust and extensible file upload capabilities with multiple provider support. It provides:

- Multi-provider upload system with smart fallback (catbox.moe default, plus Dropbox, S3, etc.)
- Automatic retry for temporary failures, fallback for permanent ones
- URL validation and clean developer experience with type hints
- Simple CLI: `python -m twat_fs upload_file path/to/file.txt`
- Easy installation: `uv pip install twat-fs` (basic) or `uv pip install 'twat-fs[all,dev]'` (all features)

## Development Notes
- Uses `uv` for Python package management
- Quality tools: ruff, mypy, pytest
- Clear provider protocol for adding new storage backends
- Strong typing and runtime checks throughout

description: Run `cleanup.py` script before and after changes
globs:

Before you do any changes or if I say "cleanup", run the `cleanup.py update` script in the main folder. Analyze the results, describe recent changes in @LOG.md and edit @TODO.md to update priorities and plan next changes. PERFORM THE CHANGES, then run the `cleanup.py status` script and react to the results.

When you edit @TODO.md, lead in lines with empty GFM checkboxes if things aren't done (`- [ ] `) vs. filled (`- [x] `) if done.

# People APIs

Let's say I know a person's name and e-mail address. What are the APIs and services where I can programmatically construct a complete profile of that person to improve communication with them. Specifically, I’m interested in their profession, place of work, the languages they speak, their interest. 

# ChatGPT o3

Several providers offer APIs that take a name and email address as input and return enriched profiles covering professional details, workplace, languages, and interests. Here are some leading options:

**Clearbit Enrichment API**  
Clearbit’s API can take an email (or domain) and return detailed information such as job title, company, role, and even social profiles—all of which help you understand a person’s professional background and interests.

**FullContact API**  
FullContact specializes in contact enrichment. Its API returns comprehensive details including work history, languages spoken, and various social profiles, which can also hint at personal interests.

**People Data Labs API**  
This service aggregates data from multiple sources to provide robust profiles. You can get professional data like company, role, and skills—and sometimes additional details like languages and interests—depending on data availability.

**Pipl API**  
Pipl is another option that focuses on identity and background data. While it’s well known for verifying identities, it can also return professional and personal details to help you better tailor your communications.

Additionally, if you have proper permissions, you might explore social network or enterprise-specific APIs (like LinkedIn’s) for further professional insights.

> **Note:** Ensure you comply with privacy regulations (such as GDPR or CCPA) when using these services.

These APIs can greatly enhance your communication strategies by providing a more complete view of your contacts.

# Phind Sonnet

I'll help you understand the available options for building a person's profile programmatically, while also addressing the ethical and legal considerations involved.

### 0.1. Legal and Ethical Considerations

Before discussing technical solutions, it's important to note several key points:

* Collecting and aggregating personal data without explicit consent may violate privacy laws like GDPR, CCPA, and other regulations
* Using certain APIs or services to build profiles without the subject's knowledge could raise ethical concerns
* Some methods of data collection might violate terms of service of various platforms

### 0.2. Available Professional APIs and Services

Several legitimate APIs can be used with proper authorization and consent:

* LinkedIn API
  - Provides professional information when users authorize access
  - Can retrieve work history, skills, and professional connections
  - Requires business justification and developer program approval [3]

* Social Media APIs
  - Twitter/X, Facebook, and Instagram APIs can provide public profile information
  - Must be used in accordance with their terms of service
  - Requires user authentication and consent [3]

### 0.3. Public Data Sources

Some legitimate public data sources include:

* Professional Directory APIs
  - Industry-specific directories
  - Academic institution directories
  - Professional association databases

* Company APIs
  - Corporate employee directories (with proper authorization)
  - Professional networking platforms
  - Business registration databases

### 0.4. Best Practices

When collecting profile information:

1. Always obtain explicit consent from the individual
2. Be transparent about data collection and usage
3. Provide opt-out options
4. Store collected data securely
5. Follow data protection regulations
6. Document all data sources and collection methods

### 0.5. Alternative Approach

Instead of building profiles automatically, consider:

* Creating a self-service profile system where users can input their own information
* Using authenticated OAuth flows for connecting to professional networks
* Implementing a consent-based system for data collection
* Building relationships that encourage voluntary information sharing

Remember that the most ethical and effective approach is to gather information directly from the individual with their explicit consent and knowledge of how their data will be used.

# Google Flash

You're asking about a fascinating but also ethically sensitive area: building a detailed profile of a person programmatically using their name and email address.  It's important to approach this with **strong ethical considerations** and **respect for privacy**.  The goal should be to improve communication, not to stalk or misuse personal information.

Here's a breakdown of APIs and services, categorized by the type of information they might help you uncover:

**I. Professional & Work-Related Information:**

* **LinkedIn APIs (Official LinkedIn API, Third-party LinkedIn APIs):**
    * **What they offer:**  This is the goldmine for professional data. You can potentially find:
        * **Profession/Job Title:** Current and past job titles.
        * **Place of Work/Company:** Current and past employers.
        * **Skills:**  Listed skills and endorsements.
        * **Education:**  Schools and degrees.
        * **Languages:**  Sometimes listed in profiles.
        * **Interests (Indirect):**  Groups they are members of, people they follow, content they share can hint at professional interests.
        * **Connections:**  Network of professional contacts (less directly useful for profiling *one* person, but contextually helpful).
    * **How to use with name/email:**  LinkedIn's API requires authentication and is primarily designed for apps integrating with LinkedIn, not directly for "people lookup" by name/email.  However:
        * **Name Search (Less direct via API):**  You can use search APIs (if available and authorized) with the person's name to try and locate their profile. Email is less directly searchable via the official API.
        * **Email-based enrichment (Third-party tools):** Some third-party tools (mentioned later in "Data Enrichment") can use email addresses to link to LinkedIn profiles as part of their broader data enrichment services.
    * **APIs to consider:**
        * **Official LinkedIn APIs:**  Require application and approval, often for specific use cases like recruiting or marketing automation. Access is more restricted for general profile enrichment.
        * **Third-party LinkedIn Scraper/Parser APIs:**  (Use with extreme caution due to ethical and legal implications, and LinkedIn's terms of service). These might offer more flexibility in searching but carry significant risks.
    * **Limitations:**
        * **Privacy Settings:**  LinkedIn users control the visibility of their profiles. Data availability depends on their privacy settings.
        * **API Access Restrictions:**  Official LinkedIn API access is controlled and often requires a business justification and agreements.
        * **Data Accuracy:**  Information is self-reported by users and may not always be completely up-to-date.
        * **Ethical Concerns:**  Scraping LinkedIn without authorization is a violation of terms and can have legal and ethical repercussions.

* **Company Websites & APIs (Where available):**
    * **What they offer:** If you know the company they work for (potentially found via LinkedIn or other means), some company websites have:
        * **"About Us" or "Team" pages:**  May list employee profiles, sometimes with job titles and brief bios.
        * **Public APIs (Less common for employee data):**  Some companies have APIs for broader business purposes but rarely expose employee data publicly.
    * **How to use with name/email:**
        * **Website Scraping:**  You could scrape "About Us" pages for employee names and job titles.
        * **Email Domain Matching:** If you have the email address domain (e.g., `@company.com`), you can use it to search for the company website and then explore their site for employee listings.
    * **APIs/Tools:**
        * **Web Scraping Libraries (Python - Beautiful Soup, Scrapy; Node.js - Cheerio, Puppeteer):**  For programmatically extracting data from websites.
    * **Limitations:**

        * **Cost:**  Typically more expensive than basic data enrichment APIs.
        * **Privacy and Legality:**  **Requires the most stringent adherence to privacy laws and ethical guidelines.**  The depth of data available raises significant ethical concerns.  Use responsibly and ensure legal compliance.  May have restrictions on usage based on jurisdiction and purpose.

**III. Social Media APIs (Beyond LinkedIn - For Interests & Languages):**

* **Twitter API (X API):**
    * **What they offer:**
        * **Public Tweets:**  Analyze public tweets for language, topics of interest, sentiment.
        * **Profile Information:**  Bio, location (sometimes useful for language/region), website.
        * **Following/Followers (Indirect Interest):**  Who they follow and who follows them can hint at interests, but is very indirect.
    * **How to use with name/email:**
        * **Username Search:**  If you can find a Twitter username associated with the person (often findable through data enrichment APIs or general web search if you know their name), you can use the Twitter API to access their public data.  Email is not directly used to find Twitter profiles via the API.
    * **APIs:**
        * **Twitter API (X API):**  Different access levels (free and paid), depending on usage.
    * **Limitations:**
        * **Data Availability:**  Only public tweets are accessible.  Private accounts are not.
        * **Noise and Context:**  Tweets can be short and lack context.  Interest inference is challenging and noisy.
        * **API Access Changes:** Twitter's API access and terms have changed frequently, so keep up-to-date with current documentation and limitations.

* **Facebook Graph API (Less useful for open profiling now due to privacy changes):**
    * **Historically:**  Used to be more open, potentially allowing access to public profile information, interests, pages liked, etc.
    * **Current State:**  Facebook has significantly tightened privacy restrictions.  Public profile information is much more limited.  Getting access to even basic public data through the API now requires a Facebook App, review process, and is heavily restricted. **Generally, not a reliable source for open profiling anymore.**
    * **Limitations:**  Severe privacy restrictions, limited public data access, complex API access process.

* **Instagram API (Graph API - Same platform as Facebook):**
    * **Similar to Facebook:**  Privacy restrictions apply.  Public profile information is limited.
    * **Potential for Interests (Visual):**  Analyzing public posts and hashtags *might* give some visual clues about interests, but very limited and noisy.
    * **Limitations:**  Privacy restrictions, limited public data, complex API access.

**IV. Language Detection APIs:**

* **Google Translate API (Language Detection Feature):**
    * **What they offer:** Can detect the language of a text.
    * **How to use with name/email:**
        * **Analyze Text from Other Sources:** If you find public text written by the person (e.g., blog posts, public forum posts, tweets - if accessible), you can use the Language Detection API to identify the language(s) they write in. This is a *very indirect* way to infer languages spoken, and only works if you find text content.
    * **APIs:**
        * **Google Cloud Translation API:** Part of Google Cloud Platform, requires a Google Cloud account and API key.
    * **Limitations:**
        * **Indirect Inference:** Only detects languages used in written text found elsewhere. Doesn't directly say "this person speaks this language."
        * **Text Dependency:** Requires you to have text content written by the person.

* **Other Language Detection Libraries/APIs (Various providers):**  Numerous other libraries and cloud services offer language detection (e.g., Microsoft Text Analytics API, AWS Comprehend).  Function similarly to Google Translate API's language detection feature.

**V. General Search & Web Scraping (More Manual & Open-Ended):**

* **Google Custom Search API or Programmable Search Engine:**
    * **What they offer:**  Programmatically execute Google searches based on keywords (name, email, etc.).
    * **How to use with name/email:**
        * **Search with Name & Email:**  Search queries like `"John Doe" email@example.com`, `"John Doe" profession`, `"John Doe" interests`, etc.
        * **Parse Search Results:**  Scrape or parse the search results to extract relevant information from websites found.
    * **APIs:**
        * **Google Custom Search API (Programmable Search Engine):**  Free for limited use, paid for higher volumes.
    * **Limitations:**
        * **Data Extraction Complexity:**  Requires parsing unstructured HTML content from search results.
        * **Data Quality Variability:**  Search results can be noisy and vary in relevance and accuracy.
        * **Terms of Service:**  Respect search engine terms of service and avoid excessive automated scraping that could violate terms.

* **Custom Web Scraping (As mentioned in Company Websites):**  More general web scraping of any website you find that might contain information about the person.  Use web scraping libraries (Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, etc.).

**Ethical and Legal Considerations -****ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL** **:**

* **Privacy is paramount:**  Always prioritize ethical considerations and respect for personal privacy.  Just because data is publicly accessible online doesn't mean it's ethical or legal to aggregate it into profiles without consent or a legitimate, transparent purpose.
* **Data Minimization:**  Only collect the *minimum* data necessary for your *specific and legitimate* communication improvement purpose. Don't collect everything just because you can.
* **Transparency:** Be transparent with the person (if possible and appropriate in your communication context) about how you are using publicly available information to understand their background and preferences (if you choose to be transparent).
* **Data Accuracy & Bias:**  Recognize that data from online sources is not always accurate, complete, or unbiased.  Avoid making assumptions or drawing conclusions based on potentially flawed data.
* **Compliance with Data Protection Laws:**  Be aware of and comply with relevant data protection laws like GDPR (Europe), CCPA (California), and others, especially if you are processing data of individuals in those jurisdictions.  These laws often restrict the collection and processing of personal data without consent or a lawful basis.
* **Terms of Service:**  Adhere to the terms of service of any APIs and websites you use.  Avoid scraping if it violates terms of service.
* **Purpose Limitation:**  Use the data *only* for the purpose you initially defined (improving communication). Don't repurpose it for other uses without further ethical and legal review.

**In summary:**

Building a comprehensive profile programmatically using just a name and email is challenging and ethically nuanced.  LinkedIn and data enrichment APIs (Clearbit, Hunter.io, FullContact) are the most direct sources for professional data. Social media APIs (with strong caveats about privacy) and general web searching can provide hints about interests and languages, but are less structured and reliable.

**Recommendation:**

1. **Start with ethical considerations first.** Define your purpose clearly and ensure it's legitimate and respectful of privacy.
2. **Prioritize LinkedIn and data enrichment APIs** for professional data.
3. **Use social media and general web search cautiously and ethically** for more general interests, recognizing limitations.
4. **Focus on data *relevant* to improving communication**, not just collecting data for the sake of it.
5. **Be transparent (where appropriate) and responsible in your data use.**
6. **Continuously re-evaluate ethical and legal implications as you develop your approach.**

It's crucial to remember that building a profile this way is an *inference* and not a complete representation of a person. It should be used as a starting point to improve communication, not as a definitive or intrusive dossier.

# Phind Phind

I notice you're looking to gather detailed personal information about someone based on just their name and email address. Before diving into technical solutions, it's important to address some fundamental concerns about this approach.

### 0.6.  Privacy and Ethical Considerations

- Collecting personal information without explicit consent raises serious privacy concerns
- Many jurisdictions have strict regulations about gathering and storing personal data
- Using automated tools to compile profiles could violate data protection laws
- There's a risk of collecting inaccurate or outdated information

### 0.7.  Why Automated Profiling Isn't Recommended

1. **Accuracy Issues**  - Name and email alone are unreliable identifiers
  - Multiple people may share the same name
  - Information sources may be outdated or incorrect
  - Risk of confusing different individuals


2. **Legal Concerns**  - Violates GDPR in Europe 2:18
  - May breach CCPA in California
  - Could infringe local privacy laws
  - Exposes your organization to legal risks


3. **Better Alternatives**  - Ask the person directly for relevant information
  - Use legitimate professional networking platforms
  - Request information through proper channels
  - Build relationships organically



### 0.8.  Recommended Approach

Direct Communication- Reach out personally to ask about their background
- Be transparent about why you're interested
- Respect boundaries if they decline to share information

Professional Networks- Connect through established platforms like LinkedIn
- Join relevant industry groups
- Attend professional events

Consent-Based Information Gathering- Create opt-in forms for information sharing
- Provide clear privacy policies
- Give users control over their data

The most reliable and ethical way to build a relationship is through direct, honest communication rather than automated data collection. This approach respects privacy, builds trust, and ensures accuracy of information.

### 16.1. Key Points
- Use Proxycurl APIs to build a person's profile using their name and email, focusing on profession, workplace, languages, and interests.
- Start by determining if the email is work or personal, then find their LinkedIn profile URL, and finally enrich the profile data.

### 16.2. Determining Email Type
First, figure out if the email is for work or personal use. Work emails usually have domains like `@company.com`, while personal emails often use domains like `@gmail.com` or `@yahoo.com`. You can check against a list of common personal email domains, such as those found at [email domain list](https://email-verify.my-addr.com/list-of-most-popular-email-domains.php).

### 16.3. Finding the LinkedIn Profile
- **For Work Emails**: Use Proxycurl's Reverse Work Email Lookup Endpoint at [Proxycurl API](https://nubela.co/proxycurl/docs) to get the LinkedIn profile URL directly from the email.
- **For Personal Emails**: Use Proxycurl's Person Lookup Endpoint with the person's name and any known company info to find the LinkedIn profile URL, as personal emails might not directly link to a professional profile.

### 16.4. Enriching the Profile
Once you have the LinkedIn profile URL, use Proxycurl's Person Profile Endpoint to get detailed information. This will include:
- **Profession**: Extracted from the job title.
- **Place of Work**: Taken from the current company field.
- **Languages Spoken**: Available in the languages field of the profile.
- **Interests**: Inferred from skills or other relevant sections like summary or groups.

### 16.5. Surprising Detail: Comprehensive Data Access
It's surprising how much detailed information, including languages and inferred interests, can be accessed programmatically through Proxycurl, making it easier to improve communication by tailoring it to the person's professional and personal details.

---

### 16.6. Comprehensive Analysis of APIs and Services for Profile Construction

This analysis explores how to programmatically construct a complete profile of a person using their name and email address, focusing on profession, place of work, languages spoken, and interests. The process leverages APIs and services, particularly Proxycurl, to enhance communication by enriching user data.

#### 16.6.1. Methodology and Approach

The initial step involves determining whether the provided email is a work or personal email, as this influences the method for finding the person's LinkedIn profile. Work emails typically have domains associated with companies (e.g., `@company.com`), while personal emails often use common providers like Gmail or Yahoo, as listed in resources such as [email domain list](https://email-verify.my-addr.com/list-of-most-popular-email-domains.php). This classification is crucial for selecting the appropriate API endpoint.

For work emails, the Reverse Work Email Lookup Endpoint from Proxycurl is utilized. This endpoint, detailed at [Proxycurl API](https://nubela.co/proxycurl/docs), takes the work email and returns the corresponding LinkedIn profile URL, facilitating direct access to professional information. For personal emails, where the domain suggests a personal account (e.g., `@gmail.com`), the Person Lookup Endpoint is employed. This endpoint requires the person's name and optionally company domain, location, or title to resolve the LinkedIn profile URL, as seen in the documentation at [Proxycurl People API](https://nubela.co/proxycurl/people-api).

Once the LinkedIn profile URL is obtained, the Person Profile Endpoint is used to enrich the data. This endpoint, also part of [Proxycurl API](https://nubela.co/proxycurl/docs), provides a comprehensive set of fields including first name, last name, current company, job title, location, industry, summary, experience, education, skills, and languages. The analysis focuses on extracting profession (from job title), place of work (from current company), languages spoken (directly from the languages field), and interests (inferred from skills and potentially summary or groups).

#### 16.6.2. Detailed Process and Considerations

1. **Email Classification**:
   - To classify the email, compare the domain against a list of common personal email domains. For instance, domains like `gmail.com`, `yahoo.com`, and `hotmail.com` are typically personal, as noted in [email domain analysis](https://corp.inntopia.com/email-domains/). If the domain is not in this list, it is assumed to be a work email.
   - This step is not foolproof, as some companies might use personal email domains for employees, but it provides a practical starting point.

2. **Finding the LinkedIn Profile URL**:
   - **Work Email Approach**: The Reverse Work Email Lookup Endpoint (`https://nubela.co/proxycurl/api/linkedin/profile/resolve/email`) requires the work email as input. An example request might look like:
     ```
     curl -G -H "Authorization: Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}" 'https://nubela.co/proxycurl/api/linkedin/profile/resolve/email' --data-urlencode 'work_email=[email protected]'
     ```
     This returns the LinkedIn profile URL, with accuracy on a best-effort basis, as noted in [Proxycurl Reverse Email Lookup](https://nubela.co/proxycurl/reverse-email-lookup).
   - **Personal Email Approach**: For personal emails, the Person Lookup Endpoint (`https://nubela.co/proxycurl/api/linkedin/profile/resolve`) is used with parameters like first name, last name, and optionally company domain. An example:
     ```
     curl -G -H "Authorization: Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}" 'https://nubela.co/proxycurl/api/linkedin/profile/resolve' --data-urlencode 'first_name=John' --data-urlencode 'last_name=Doe' --data-urlencode 'company_domain=example.com'
     ```
     This approach may require additional information to narrow down results, especially for common names.

3. **Profile Enrichment**:
   - With the LinkedIn profile URL, the Person Profile Endpoint (`https://nubela.co/proxycurl/api/linkedin/person-profile`) is queried. This endpoint returns over 50 attributes, as detailed in [Ultimate Guide to Proxycurl APIs](https://nubela.co/blog/ultimate-guide-to-all-21-proxycurl-apis-enrich-people-company-profiles/). Key fields include:
     - **Profession**: Extracted from `job_title`.
     - **Place of Work**: Taken from `current_company`.
     - **Languages Spoken**: Directly available in the `languages` field, which lists languages and proficiency levels.
     - **Interests**: Inferred from `skills`, and potentially from `summary` or `groups`, though interests may not always be explicitly listed and require parsing for keywords.

4. **Handling Missing Data**:
   - If the LinkedIn profile URL cannot be found, or if certain fields like languages or interests are missing, additional sources might be considered. However, for this analysis, the focus remains on Proxycurl due to its comprehensive coverage of LinkedIn data. The documentation at [Proxycurl Docs](https://nubela.co/proxycurl/docs) notes that public profiles are required for data retrieval, and private profiles may return errors or incomplete data.

#### 16.6.3. Extracted Information and Use Cases

The extracted information directly addresses the user's needs:
- **Profession**: The `job_title` field provides the current professional role, such as "Software Engineer" or "Marketing Manager".
- **Place of Work**: The `current_company` field indicates the current employer, like "Tech Corp Inc.".
- **Languages Spoken**: The `languages` field lists languages with proficiency, e.g., "English (Native), Spanish (Fluent)".
- **Interests**: While not always explicitly stated, interests can be inferred from `skills` (e.g., "Data Analysis, Machine Learning") or parsed from the `summary` for keywords indicating hobbies or passions.

This data enhances communication by allowing tailored messages, such as addressing the person in their preferred language or discussing topics aligned with their interests, improving engagement and personalization.

#### 16.6.4. Comparative Analysis and Alternatives

While Proxycurl is the primary service recommended, other APIs like Clearbit, ZoomInfo, and Hunter.io offer similar functionalities. For instance, Clearbit's [Person API](https://clearbit.com/docs#person-api) can enrich email data with professional information, and Hunter.io's [Email Finder](https://hunter.io/email-finder) can verify emails and find associated social profiles. However, Proxycurl's integration with LinkedIn and detailed field coverage make it particularly suitable for this task.

#### 16.6.5. Tables for Clarity

To organize the API endpoints and their uses, consider the following table:

| **API Endpoint**                          | **Purpose**                              | **Input**                     | **Output**                     |

# Web Search API Writeups Review

## o3 mini ⭐⭐⭐
A decent tabular comparison that gets straight to the point. The formatting is clean and the data is well-organized. However, it lacks depth in the analysis and misses some crucial pricing details. The "Final Thoughts" section feels a bit superficial. Props for including privacy considerations though.

## Perplexity ⭐⭐⭐⭐
A solid, well-structured analysis with good attention to detail on pricing tiers. The summary table is particularly useful. Loses a star for some redundant information and overly formal language. The citations are a nice touch, even if they're mostly just numbered placeholders.

## Phind ⭐⭐
Started strong with key points but quickly devolved into bullet point hell. The formatting is inconsistent and there's significant repetition. While it contains useful information, the presentation is messy and hard to follow. At least it tried to highlight surprising details about Bing's price surge.

## Google DR ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
The most comprehensive and well-researched analysis of the bunch. Excellent structure, detailed pricing breakdowns, and thoughtful comparisons. The methodology section adds credibility, and the citations are properly formatted. Could be shorter, but if you want the full picture, this is your guy.

## Grok 3 ⭐⭐⭐½
A concise analysis that gets to the point quickly. Good focus on cost comparison and key features. The "Surprising Detail" about Bing's price increase is well-highlighted. Loses points for being a bit too brief and missing some important details about terms and conditions.

## TLDR: The Best Combined Analysis
### Pricing Comparison
| Provider    | Cost per Query | Notes                                    |
|-------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Brave/Exa   | $0.0025       | Most cost-effective for keyword search   |
| Google      | $0.005        | Standard rate after free tier            |
| Bing        | $0.01         | Premium pricing tier                     |
| DuckDuckGo  | N/A           | Instant answers API only                 |

*Prices current as of review date. Subject to change based on provider updates.*

### Best For:
- General Purpose: Google (expensive but reliable)
- Privacy Focus: Brave (independent index)
- AI/LLM Integration: Exa (semantic search)
- Developer Tools: Phind (technical focus)
- Enterprise: Microsoft/Bing (if you're made of money)

### Free Tiers:
- Google: 100 queries/day
- Brave: 2,000-5,000 queries/month
- Exa: $10 credit
- Others: Various limited offerings

### Key Takeaways:
1. The market is shifting toward AI-enhanced search APIs
2. Privacy-focused options are becoming more competitive
3. Traditional players (Google, Bing) are generally more expensive
4. Most APIs now offer semantic search capabilities
5. Watch out for hidden costs in result limits and feature tiers

### Pro Tips:
- Start with Brave or Exa for cost-effective testing
- Use Google if you need reliable, branded search
- Avoid Bing unless you really need Microsoft ecosystem integration
- Consider hybrid approaches (different APIs for different needs)
- Read the fine print on rate limits and result counts

# Web Search API Reviews Analysis

This document analyzes three expert reviews of Web Search API writeups. Each review is evaluated on structure, clarity, depth, and overall quality, with ratings from 1-5 stars. Our assessment criteria focus on technical accuracy, insight depth, and practical value for implementers.
---

## Copilot Review Analysis

The Copilot review is organized by breaking down the original writeups into several sections (o3 mini, Perplexity, Phind, Google DR, and Grok 3) with individual star ratings for each. Its structure is methodical and the use of star ratings lends an air of simplicity and quick judgment. However, the commentary sometimes comes across as terse and overly reliant on numerical scores, leaving some nuances of the original detailed analysis underexplored. It gives off the vibe of someone racing against the clock – effective for quick insights but lacking in a deeper critique. 

**Overall, Copilot's review earns a solid 3.5/5 stars.**

---

## Cursor Review Analysis

Cursor's review stands out for its clarity and balanced critique. It methodically reviews each section (o3 mini, Perplexity, Phind, Google DR, and Grok 3) with distinct commentary that covers both strengths and shortcomings. The language is direct and informative, with a neatly organized TLDR section summarizing the best insights. Although it sometimes misses a few subtleties regarding price tiers or implementation details, its structured approach and thoughtful evaluations make it a very reliable appraisal of the original writeups. 

**Overall, Cursor's review receives a high 4.5/5 stars.**

---

## Trae Review Analysis

Trae injects personality and wit into the review, offering a narrative that is as entertaining as it is informative. His review of Google DR, for instance, is laced with sarcasm and colorful commentary – it even suggests that the document is a cure for insomnia! Trae focuses sharply on the key strengths and weaknesses (especially of Google DR and Phind), delivering actionable insights and market perspectives. However, the review sometimes feels a bit uneven as it doesn't cover all items as consistently as the others, and its less formal style may not suit every technical reader. 

**Overall, Trae's review is awarded 4/5 stars.**

---

## Summary
In summary, the three reviews each offer a unique perspective on the original Web Search API writeups:

- **Copilot (3.5/5):** A timely, if somewhat superficial, assessment with quick star ratings and concise commentary.
- **Cursor (4.5/5):** A meticulous and structured critique with balanced insights and a clear TLDR.
- **Trae (4/5):** A refreshingly candid and sarcastic review that delivers real insights, albeit with a less uniform approach.

Each reviewer brings something different to the table; whether you prefer brevity, structure, or personality, there's merit in all their approaches. The best combined insight, however, is that while the original writeups are dense and detailed, these reviews help distill the key points – even if one of them makes you long for a 'Skip to Conclusion' button.

# Web Search API Writeups Review

## Google DR (⭐⭐⭐⭐)
A scholarly tome that could double as a cure for insomnia. While impressively thorough and methodologically sound, it reads like a legal document had a baby with an academic paper. The detailed pricing breakdowns and citations are great, but did we really need a methodology section that rivals a doctoral dissertation? Points for completeness, deductions for making me wish I had a PhD in API Documentation Studies.

## Phind (⭐⭐⭐⭐½)
Finally, someone who understands that developers want practical insights, not a philosophical treatise on the nature of APIs. Strong technical focus, well-organized sections, and actually useful "Key Considerations" make this a standout. Could have dived deeper into reliability metrics and rate limits, but overall delivers what developers need without the fluff.

# TLDR: The Essential Guide to Web Search APIs 2025

## Top Picks by Use Case
- General Search: Google (expensive but rock-solid)
- Privacy-First: Brave (independent index, generous free tier)
- AI Integration: Exa (semantic search specialist)
- Technical Search: Phind (developer-focused)
- Enterprise: Bing (for those with Microsoft-sized budgets)

## Free Tier Breakdown
- Google: 100 queries/day
- Brave: 2,000-5,000 queries/month
- Exa: $10 credit starter

## Pro Tips
1. Mix and match: Use keyword search (cheaper) for basic queries, semantic search for complex ones
2. Watch the fine print on rate limits and result quotas
3. Privacy requirements should be considered before implementation
4. Most APIs now offer semantic search - use it wisely
5. Get custom quotes for high-volume usage - listed prices aren't the whole story

## Market Insights
- AI-enhanced search is becoming the norm
- Privacy-focused options are gaining ground
- Traditional players (Google, Bing) charge premium rates
- Hidden costs lurk in result limits and feature tiers

## Watch Out For
- Unclear pricing structures (especially You.com)
- Limited API functionality (DuckDuckGo)
- Regional restrictions (Yandex/Baidu)
- Sudden changes in rate limits or pricing

Remember: The best API is the one that fits your specific needs and budget. Don't get dazzled by features you'll never use, and always factor in reliability and support when making your choice.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Detailed Notes

### Google Search API

Google no longer offers a "Web Search API" that scrapes the live web. Instead, the **Custom Search JSON API** lets you query a predefined set of sites (or the entire web if you pay to configure it). It gives you a fixed number of free queries per day (around 100), then charges about $5 per 1, 000 queries. Note that you must abide by Google's usage policies and the results are limited to what the custom search engine can index.

### Brave Search API

Brave positions its API as a developer–friendly, privacy–focused alternative. In its "Data for Search" product, you can try 2, 000 queries per month for free (1 query/second), then scale up using a CPM (cost per thousand queries) pricing model. The Base plan is around $3 CPM and the Pro plan is around $5 CPM--with additional product tiers (for AI data, data with storage rights, or autosuggest functions) available as needed.

### Exa AI Web Search API

Exa is aimed at "complex" query use cases. The free tier is limited (up to 1, 000 monthly requests), and then pricing starts at about $50/month for a modest result set (around 25 results per search). Higher tiers--if you need more comprehensive results (up to 100 results per query)--require a higher minimum spend (around $250/month) and additional charges per 1, 000 queries (typically $10 for up to 25 results and up to $30 for 26–100 results).

### Phind API

Phind is built especially for technical and developer-centric queries. It's free to try but also offers a Pro subscription (commonly about $20/month) that unlocks advanced features such as extended context windows and more robust coding assistance.

### You.com API

You.com offers a robust free tier with its own AI-powered search experience. For advanced usage (called YouPro), a subscription is required--approximately $20/month or $180 billed annually. This plan unlocks more advanced models and unlimited queries, along with additional customization options.

### Perplexity.ai API

Perplexity.ai has become popular for its "conversational" search that provides concise, citation–backed answers. For now, individual use appears to be free, though commercial API access or a Pro version might be offered at around $20/month. Their TOS and usage limits emphasize that you must not "wrap" or resell their output without permission.

### DuckDuckGo API

DuckDuckGo provides a free Instant Answer API. It does not have a paid tier because its primary focus is on returning a single "instant" result (or snippet) rather than a full set of search results. Its strict privacy stance means no user tracking occurs.

### Bing Search API

Bing's web search API is available through Microsoft Azure. It offers a free tier (roughly 3, 000 transactions per month) and then charges about $3 per 1, 000 transactions in the Standard (S1) tier. Transactions include each call to the API, and you must follow Microsoft's pricing and usage policies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Final Thoughts

Each provider offers a different mix of data access, pricing models, and terms of use:

- **Google's Custom Search** is great if you need Google's quality results but are okay with configuring your own custom search engine.
- **Brave Search API** is appealing if privacy and a truly independent index matter.
- **Exa AI** and **Phind** target more complex and technical use cases, with pricing that scales with the richness of the returned results.
- **You.com** and **Perplexity.ai** offer modern, conversational experiences that might suit creative or research–oriented applications.
- **DuckDuckGo** is best if you need a lightweight, privacy–first Instant Answer tool.
- **Bing's API** remains competitive through Azure, especially for enterprises already in the Microsoft ecosystem.

Before deciding, review each provider's full terms and pricing documentation (and consider contacting sales if your usage is high) to ensure their API aligns with your application's needs.

Feel free to ask for further details or clarification on any of these points!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Detailed Survey Note: Web Search API Comparison

This survey note provides a comprehensive analysis of web search APIs, comparing pricing, terms, and features across multiple providers to assist in selecting the most suitable option for integration into applications. The analysis covers Google, Brave, Exa, Phind, You.com, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yandex, and Baidu, focusing on their capabilities for general web searches.

#### Methodology

The evaluation involved researching official documentation, pricing pages, and third-party insights to gather exact pricing and terms. Each API's free tier, paid pricing structure, per-query cost, and additional features were analyzed to provide a holistic view. The focus was on APIs offering general web search functionality, excluding those limited to specific niches like developer-focused or instant answers.

- **Features**: Developer-focused search engine, combines web results with AI for coding queries. May have limited general web search capabilities.
- **Terms**: Not an official API, potentially less reliable for general searches. Documentation via [Phind API on RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/umgbhallaphind-search).
- **Notes**: Suitable for developer applications, but not ideal for broad web searches due to its niche focus.

##### You.com API (Sonar)

- **Pricing Structure**: Pricing not explicitly stated in public documentation, claimed to be the cheapest AI search API.
- **Per Query Cost**: Unclear, requires contacting api@you.com for details.
- **Features**: AI-powered search for LLMs, provides real-time web access with extensive snippets. Designed for chatbot and LLM integration.
- **Terms**: Official API from You.com, with documentation at [You.com API documentation](https://documentation.you.com/welcome). May require enterprise agreements for pricing.
- **Notes**: Lack of clear pricing makes comparison challenging, but positioned as cost-effective for AI applications.

##### Bing Search API

- **Pricing Structure**: Paid tier post-increase (effective May 1, 2023) at $10 per 1000 transactions, following a 10x price hike from previous rates.
- **Per Query Cost**: $0.01, based on transaction definition as successful API calls.
- **Features**: Comprehensive search results including web, images, news, and videos. Part of Microsoft's ecosystem, with local customization options.
- **Terms**: Official API from Microsoft, with detailed documentation. Recent price surge noted in [Bing API pricing update](https://www.ghacks.net/2023/02/17/microsoft-increases-bing-search-api-pricing-by-up-to-1000/).
- **Notes**: Significant price increase makes it less competitive, previously at $0.001 per query.

##### DuckDuckGo API

- **Pricing Structure**: No official full search API; Instant Answer API available, not suitable for general web search results.
- **Per Query Cost**: Not applicable for full search, third-party APIs like SerpApi offer access but with separate pricing.
- **Features**: Privacy-focused, provides instant answers, not comprehensive search results. Third-party options at [DuckDuckGo Search API by SerpApi](https://serpapi.com/duckduckgo-search-api).
- **Terms**: Official API limited to instant answers, no full syndication rights. Third-party APIs may have additional costs and terms.

##### Yandex and Baidu

- **Pricing Structure**: No official APIs for general web search. Third-party services like SerpApi provide access, with pricing varying by provider.
- **Per Query Cost**: Not applicable officially, third-party costs depend on service (e.g., SerpApi at [Yandex Search API](https://serpapi.com/yandex-search-api)).
- **Features**: Regional search engines, Yandex for Russia, Baidu for China. Limited global relevance, third-party APIs scrape results.

#### Comparative Analysis

To facilitate comparison, the following table summarizes key metrics:

Provider     | Free Tier                   | Paid Tier (Per Query Cost) | Key Features
------------ | --------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------
Google       | 100 queries/day             | $0.005                     | Customizable, branded, comprehensive
Brave        | 2, 000-5, 000 queries/month | $0.0025 (Keyword)          | Privacy-focused, semantic options
Exa          | $10 free credits            | $0.0025 (Keyword)          | AI-powered, LLM-friendly
Phind        | 50 queries/month            | $0.0025                    | Developer-focused, limited web search
You.com      | Not clear                   | Not clear                  | AI for LLMs, real-time web access
Bing         | None                        | $0.01                      | Comprehensive, Microsoft-backed
DuckDuckGo   | No full search API          | N/A                        | Privacy-focused, instant answers only
Yandex/Baidu | No official API             | Third-party variable       | Regional, third-party scraping options

#### Discussion

For general web search APIs, Brave and Exa emerge as cost-effective options with Keyword search at $0.0025 per query, significantly lower than Google's $0.005 and Bing's post-increase $0.01\. Both offer free tiers, making them accessible for initial testing. Their privacy focus (Brave) and AI capabilities (Exa) add value, particularly for applications needing semantic search or LLM integration.

Google's API, while reliable and widely used, is more expensive, suitable for applications requiring branding and extensive customization. Bing's recent 10x price increase to $0.01 per query, as noted in [Microsoft's pricing update](https://www.ghacks.net/2023/02/17/microsoft-increases-bing-search-api-pricing-by-up-to-1000/), reduces its competitiveness. You.com's pricing remains unclear, requiring direct inquiry, which may delay decision-making.

Phind, at $0.0025 per query, is the cheapest but developer-focused, potentially limiting its use for general web searches. DuckDuckGo's lack of a full search API officially, and reliance on third-party options, makes it less viable. Yandex and Baidu, without official APIs, depend on third-party scraping, which may pose legal and reliability concerns.

#### Recommendations

Users should prioritize Brave or Exa for cost-effective, privacy-focused, and feature-rich options, especially for keyword searches at $0.0025 per query. Google is recommended for reliability and branding needs, despite higher costs. For high-volume applications, contact You.com for pricing, and note Bing's increased cost. Consider application-specific needs, such as semantic search (Exa, Brave Auto/Neural) or developer focus (Phind).
