        # additional_dependencies are managed by hatch/uv in the main env
        # but for pre-commit, specify necessary types here if not picked up automatically
        # For example:
        # additional_dependencies: ['types-Pillow', 'types-tenacity']
        # However, it's often better to rely on mypy finding these from the project's venv
        # if pre-commit is run within an activated venv or if mypy is configured project-wide.
        # For now, keeping it simple. MyPy will use project's pyproject.toml for config.
